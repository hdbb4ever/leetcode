For 876:
   1) two points, fast point and slow point
   2) using next->next should check next empty first

For 206:
   1) the recursive version is tricky
   2) recursive version need to note that:
      when the func comes back, the following nodes reverse, the head is changed
      we need to append the current to the end of reversed, how to get the tail?
      current.next is the tail, so just use current.next for the tail
   3) wrong conclusion, rec is faster than iter, leetcode website didn't report 
      the timing well and confused me, get the good timing with re-submission.
